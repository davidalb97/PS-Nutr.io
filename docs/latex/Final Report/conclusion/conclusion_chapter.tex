\chapter{Conclusion}

This group developed a platform 

\section{Future development}

As this project represents a final bachelor's project, some future work could still be done in order
to publish and deploy the platform to the public, making it more successful and profitable.\\

Here are some topics the group agreed that could belong to a project's future development:

\subsubsection{Statistics analysis}
Given that one of this project's main strengths is information storage and mapping, the group found
relevant that statistics analysis should be done, in order to help and provide other work fields
information that could be useful.\\

However every data that is collected should be properly disclaimed and only the information that
would not compromised the user's privacy should be colectable.

\subsubsection{Interactions with other platforms alike}

As written in the last topic, the information could enrich the environment of nutrition.

\subsubsection{Improved social system}

\subsubsection{Client UI/UX revision}

\subsubsection{Certified members}

\subsubsection{Two-factor authentication}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistics analysis without compromising the user's privacy;
    \item Interactions with other platforms, provinding more information to the world of nutrition and health platforms;
    \item A more appealing social system to motivate the platform's community to make more submissions;
    \item A better UI/UX approach inside each client;
    \item Certified members, such as nutritionists, that could provide data's validation;
    \item Two-factor authentication to improve client authentication's security;
\end{itemize}
