\chapter{Introduction}

In the context of the undergraduate progamme of science and computer
engineering at the university of "Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa" 
for the course "Project and Seminary" \cite{ps},
it is considered the development of a Bachelor's final project with the 
intended learning outcomes of applying skills acquired 
throughout the course to solve a problem, either individually or as a team,
describing and testing the developed work, and defending technical solutions.\\

With this purpose, the elaboration of this project aims to describe and
contextualize mentioned objectives and activities developed by the students
which will compose not only as a grading tool, but also as a moment of critical 
reflexion and learning.\\

This project and its' work was developed under the tutorage of engineer 
Fernando Miguel Gamboa de Carvalho during the 2019/2020 summer semester of 
"Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa".\\

In the elaboration of this project, the students chose a field which could
facilatate and contribute in the improvement of day-to-day activities of people
with diabetes, and as such, developed a multi-platform system capable of 
providing users an accurate carbohydrate quantity for meals served in restaurants.\\

This document is structured in 6 distinct parts, with an appendix which contains additional
information about a topic, having references pointing to it when necessary.\\

We will conclude with a final remark about future work 
and a reflexion regarding our academic course and lessons learned.\\
