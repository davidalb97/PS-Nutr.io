This chapter shows what has been achieved and developed to this date.\\

As previously written in the project's roadmap, this project has already a working relational database
and a HTTP server, developed with postgreSQL and with kotlin and spring mvc, respectively. The group also
managed to achieve, by this date as planned, its first working plaform client - the android mobile application, developed
with kotlin. This last one, it is still a prototype, so it lacks some features that will be completed during the next weeks.
