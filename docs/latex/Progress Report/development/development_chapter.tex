	\section{Project's Roadmap}

    According to the proposed plan, the group managed to fullfill almost all the objectives
    that were planned to be accomplished by this time - a relational database, a working HTTP server
    and a prototype Android aplication that can make requests to the previously stated server and 
    use its information to display lists and detailed views.
