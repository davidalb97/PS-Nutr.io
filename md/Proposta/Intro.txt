The idea that every field of study can be digitalized in order to ease monotonous tasks 
is continuosly growing in the modern world. Nutr.io aims to tackle the field of Type 1 diabetes, 
given its growing prevalence in Portugal[1] and the world.

One of those monotonous tasks is the count and measurement of carbohydrates in meals used
to administer the correspondent amount of insulin, along with their blood levels, to maintain a healthy
lifestyle. A task that heavily relies on having access to food databases[link]  
and knowledge of how much portions the meal has - usually by using a digital balance or doing estimations.

What happens when said tools are missing? 
Eating in restaurants is the perfect example that showcases a gap that Nutr.io aims to fill. 
Many nutrional applications do not provide data for restaurants' meals [3] nor does the user bring his digital
balance from home - resulting in a faulty carbohydrate count and therefore administering an incorrect insulin value.

The main goal of this project is to design a system that offers the Type 1 diabetic community a way 
to facilitate difficult carbohydrate measurement situations, like restaurants, by providing a database
of nutrional information for restaurants; and by calibrating the accuracy of given 
data based on the community's contribution.
