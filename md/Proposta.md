## Background

The idea that every field of study can be digitalized in order to ease monotonous tasks is continuosly growing in the modern world. Our project aims to tackle the field of Type 1 diabetes, given its growing prevalence in Portugal[1] and the world.

One of those monotonous tasks is the count and measurement of carbohydrates in meals used to administer the correspondent amount of insulin, along with their blood levels, to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A task that heavily relies on having access to food databases[link] and knowledge of how much portions the meal has - usually by using a digital balance or doing estimations.

Eating in restaurants is the perfect example that showcases a gap in this field, that our project, 
Nutr.io, aims to fill.  Many nutrional applications do not provide data for restaurants' meals [3] nor does the user bring his digital balance from home - resulting in a faulty carbohydrate count and therefore administering an incorrect insulin value.

The main goal of this project is to design a system that offers the Type 1 diabetic community a way to facilitate difficult carbohydrate measurement situations, like restaurants, by providing a database of nutrional information for restaurants; and by calibrating the accuracy of given data based on the community's contribution.

## Objectives

Given the gaps previously stated, Nutr.io aims to develop a system that offers the users carbohydrates values of meals served in restaurants. The information is collected from external APIs and gradually calibrated  by using other sources, which is stored in the system's database.

This project aims to achieve this by fulfilling the following goals by the end of development:

* Use external APIs to obtain data from meals and restaurants;
* Maintain a database that contains the baseline nutritional values and their calibration provided by other sources;
* Obtain baseline nutritional information about meals of any given restaurant. (Even when restaurants don't supply their menus to any API);
* A contribution system that uses information from various sources to calibrate the system's data such as:    
  - System's community (mandatory objective)    
  - Nutritionists (optional)    
  - Restaurant owners (optional)
* Implement registration and authentication support, so that authenticated users can contribute to the community.
